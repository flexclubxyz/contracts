# Flexclub Smart Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for the Flexclub project, a decentralized, goal-based saving platform built on the blockchain.

## Overview

Flexclub smart contracts are designed to manage onchain goal-based saving clubs. They handle the pooling of funds, earning interest through DeFi platforms like Aave, and distributing the funds back to the members based on their contributions and the club's goal achievement.
